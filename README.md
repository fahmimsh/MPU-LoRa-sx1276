This repository program is used for monitoring public transportation such as metroline, MPU, and so on. There are 2 programs, namely node programs installed in vehicles by sending GPS data and gateway programs to receive data from node x vehicles to be sent to the database. Then the passenger android application will be able to find out the location of the vehicle closest to the location of the passenger vehicle.
